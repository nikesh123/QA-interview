Note: I  HAVE GENERATED TWO HTML REPORTS AND CSV FILES FOR 2 CASES
      And I HAVE PRINTED IN PDF FORMAT FOR BOTH HTML REPORTS NAMED html_report_1 and html_report_2
      Html_report_1 is the case 1 where each thread has 1 second of delay in sending request (ramp up : 1000 seconds)
      Html_report_2 is the case 2 where ramp up period = 1 second, hence all 1k threads (users) access the site in overall 1 second
      
     (P.S: I ran two cases load test because i was not clear about exact condition given in question, so i executed both possible cases)      

CASE 1: RAMP UP PERIOD : 1000 SECONDS (THAT IS DELAY OF 1 SECOND BETWEEN EACH THREAD IN A THREAD GROUP OF 1000)
CASE 2: RAMP UP PERIOD : 1 SECOND (1000 THREADS ACCESSING THE SITE IN 1 SECOND)


STEPS INVOLVED IN GUI MODE:
sTEP 1: I CREATED A NEW TEST PLAN
STEP 2: I ADDED A THREAD GROUP WHERE I PASSED 1000 THREADS IN THE THREADS SECTION
STEP 3: I CONFIGURED THE RAMP UP PERIOD

STEP 4: I ADDED A SAMPLER - HTTP REQUEST, TO ACCESS THE ORANGEHRM WEBSITE
STEP 5: I ADDED THE URL TO BE ACCESSED, (HOME PAGE) AND FOLLOWING WEB PAGES PATH IN PATH SECTION
STEP 6: ADDED LISTENERS TO VIEW RESULTS:
          VIEW RESULTS TREE and
          SUMMARY REPORT
       With view results tree we can see each and every request thats sent to the server
       and whether its passed or not immediately (Green : Passed, Red: Failed)

STEP 7: SAVED THE TEST

AFTER THE TEST WAS DESIGNED AND SAVED, I RAN THE BELOW CODE TO RUN THE TEST, GENERATE CSV AND THEN HTML REPORT OF THE TEST


THE COMMAND TO GENERATE REPORT IS AS BELOW:


C:\Users\Nikesh\Desktop\apache-jmeter-5.6.3\bin>jmeter -n -t OrangeHRM.jmx -l /Users/Nikesh/Desktop/Jmeter/OrangeHRM_2.csv -e -o /Users/Nikesh/Desktop/Jmeter/htmlreport/


I have used the above command in CLI to generate a report
(Paths are Local and Varies with the machine)

In the above command,
the following are the modes used
-n: Non-GUI mode
-t: Path to the JMX file (Test Plan)
-l: Path to save the results file
-e: Generate the dashboard report
-o: Output directory for the HTML report


Method 2:
We can Also Generate HTML Report in our own local machine by using the CSV file
If the HTML Report Thats Generated in my local machine does not load in your browser, 
then I will have generated CSV file for the Load Test also shared, using which you can generate HTML Report File

Thank You
