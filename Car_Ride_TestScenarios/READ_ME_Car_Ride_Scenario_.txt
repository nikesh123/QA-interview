Hi, Ma'am,

I Have Written Most Possible Scenarios During A 15 Hour
Long Car Drive to a Remote Location

I Have Chosen Gherkin Language Format to Cover the 
Scenarios

In The Gherkin Feature File,
I have included repeating Steps in every scenario
separately in The Background Section at the top
Because these steps are same for every scenario and its
not good practice to repeat steps

I have used | Examples | to pass multiple variables
to a parametre wherever required

I might have missed few more scenarios but i tried to cover most common possible ones
in a proper format

Thank You
